iiii  -  Irc It Immensely Improved
====

This is a wrapper for ii and tmux. To use this, drop the script iiii somewhere in your $PATH, edit and copy the config to ~/.ii/config, run `iiii start`, then either background it or open a new term, and run `iiii v <host> #<channel>`. This script is not very full-featured, but I still plan on improving it.
